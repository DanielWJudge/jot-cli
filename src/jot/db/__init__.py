"""Database access layer for jot.

This package contains database repositories and data access logic.
The db package MUST use only stdlib (sqlite3) and primitive types.
It MUST NOT import from core/, commands/, or monitor/ to maintain clean architecture.

# Package is empty initially - will be populated in future stories
